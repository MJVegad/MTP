Firewall
----------
packet size=1500B
------------------
Average ISR time without module ==> 208.33 us (over 50 random samples) (A)
Average ISR time with module (with out processing) ==> 210.03 us (over 50 random samples) (A+B)
Average ISR time with module (with processing) ==> 32.23 us (over 50 random samples) ((A-X)+B)
Average ISR time with/without module on guest ==> 163.46 us (over 50 random samples) (C)
Average time taken for a packet processing by a MB functionality => (D) 
Average bridge processing time + other ISR time saved due to module ==> X
X depends on the action taken on the packet once it is processed ==> dropped or forwarded

Avg. packet processing time (without module) by MB = A + C + D = 371.79 us + D
Avg. packet processing time (with module) by MB, if packet forwarded to MB = A + B + C + D = 373.49 us + D
						 if packet not forwarded to MB = A - X + B = 32.23 us (packet dropped, Firewall example)
						 if packet not forwarded to MB = A + B = 73.70 us (packet forwarded, LoadBalancer example) 

Here, we can observe that (A+C+D) is almost equals to (A+B+C+D) and (A-X+B) << (A+C+D). So, this part of firewall functionality is worth offloading to Hypervisor.


packet size=52B
----------------
Average ISR time without module ==> 87.58 us (over 50 random samples) (A)
Average ISR time with module (with out processing) ==> 89.38 us (over 50 random samples) (A+B)
Average ISR time with module (with processing) ==> 26.15 us (over 50 random samples) ((A-X)+B)
Average ISR time with/without module on guest ==> 59.96 us (over 50 random samples) (C)
Average time taken for a packet processing by a MB functionality => (D) 
Average bridge processing time + other ISR time saved due to module ==> X
X depends on the action taken on the packet once it is processed ==> dropped or forwarded

Avg. packet processing time (without module) by MB = A + C + D = 147.54 + D
Avg. packet processing time (with module) by MB, if packet forwarded to MB = A + B + C + D = 149.34 us + D
						 if packet not forwarded to MB = A - X + B = 26.15 us (packet dropped, Firewall example)
						 if packet not forwarded to MB = A + B = 73.70 us (packet forwarded, LoadBalancer example) 

Here, we can observe that (A+C+D) is almost equals to (A+B+C+D) and (A-X+B) << (A+C+D). So, this part of firewall functionality is worth offloading to Hypervisor.
